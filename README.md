# Plastic-Consumption-Calc
A python based calculator that shows your plastic footprint based on your usage of non reusable materials.
This calculator will take the amount of single use plastics used in a week such as (bags, cups and straws) and provide the amount of plastic you have used in a week, month and year. 
It will then take that information and compare it to a national, and hopefully worldly average.
The calculator will also take into account any monentary savings. A majority of coffee and grocery establishments provide discounts and or reimbursements for using resuable items. Starbucks for example provide customers with a 10 cent discount when using a reusable mug and whole foods offers a 5 cent discount for reusable bags. The calculator will show the savings on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis based on how much a consumer uses.
This program may help local authorites and green groups come up with ways to motivate people to use reusable items. If the federal government came up with a program that pays or discounts individals for using resubale materials then im certain the amount of waste created will be greatly reduced. 

# Resources
The code used in this program is soley created by me. I have borrowed some calculations from earth promoting organizations and monetary savings from coopreations to make this calculator reasonably accurate.

# Sites Used 
Wholefoods.com, Starbucks.com , phys.org , vox.com , python.org, epa.gov

# HOW TO USE:
Make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer.
You can find the files to install python at python.org
Once you have Python installed you will need to double click the plastic-footprint-calc.py to run the program

Upon opening the program will ask you for an awnser to the question. What type of plastic have you used this week? (The calculator can only handle one item at this time). Your options are bags, cups, or straws

Enter in your desired item and the calculator will ask you to estimate how many times you have used this item in a week.

After inputting that information the calculator will show you the total amount of plastics in grams that you haveused and any monetary savings that could have occured if you selected an elgible item.

The calculator will then ask if you would like to know your standing compared nationally, Enter Yes or No

Depending on your awnser the calculator will show how your plastic usage compares nationally.
