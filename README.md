# Plastic-Consumption-Calc
A python based calculator that shows your plastic footprint based on your usage of non reusable materials.
This calculator will take the amount of single use plastics used in a week such as (bags, cups and straws) and provide the amount of plastic you have used in a week, month and year. 
The calculator will also take into account any monentary savings. A majority of coffee and grocery establishments provide discounts and or reimbursements for using resuable items. Starbucks for example provide customers with a 10 cent discount when using a reusable mug and whole foods offers a 5 cent discount for reusable bags. The calculator will show the savings on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis based on how much a consumer uses.
This program may help local authorites and green groups come up with ways to motivate people to use reusable items. If the federal government came up with a program that pays or discounts individals for using resubale materials then im certain the amount of waste created will be greatly reduced. 


# Resources
The code used in this program is soley created by me. I have been inspired by some code on stackoverflow when I was trying to get some loops to work. The specifc sites that I got my data from will be mentioned below. Any weight caclulations was done at home on my free time. 

# Sites Used 
Wholefoods.com, Starbucks.com , phys.org , vox.com , python.org, epa.gov

# HOW TO USE:
Make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer.
You can find the files to install python at python.org
Once you have Python installed you will need to double click the plastic-footprint-calc.py to run the program

Upon opening the program will ask you for an awnser to the question. What type of plastic have you used this week? (The calculator can only handle one item at this time). Your options are bags, cups, or straws

Enter in your desired item and the calculator will ask you to estimate how many times you have used this item in a week.

After inputting that information the calculator will show you the total amount of plastics in grams that you have used for that particular item.

The calculator will enter the second phase where it will show you any monetary savings if you used a reusable bag or cup at a specific establishment.

For example, Starbucks and Wholefoods offers discounts when you use reusable items. Starbucks offers 10 cents off your order and Wholefoods offers 5 cents.

The Calculator will then have you choose either Starbucks or whole foods. After choosing the establishment it will ask you how many times that week did you use that specific item. For Starbucks it will ask you cups, For Wholefoods it will ask you bags.

Then it will tell you how much cents you would save if you used a resuable item.

The program then ends. If you want to calculate another item just run the script again!


# Future Features

So there was a good amount of features that I wanted to have in this program but due to life it was not implemented. I am hoping on adding these features soon. 

I would like the calculator to be able to loop back to the original selection without re running the script.

I am also planning on adding other items such as ziploc bags, shampoo conatiners water bottles etc.

 This is something that I am planning on working on in a feature release! *The calculator will then ask if you would like to know your standing compared nationally, Enter Yes or No*
 
 # Current Bugs
 
 Currently there is a bug in the program where it will only calculate Starbucks savings and not anything else.
