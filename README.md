# Plastic-Footprint-Calc
A python based calculator that shows your plastic footprint based on your usage of non reusable materials.
This calculator will take the amount of single use plastics used in a week such as (bags, cups and straws) and provide the amount of plastic you have used in a week, month and year. 
It will then take that information and compare it to a national, and hopefully worldly average.
The calculator will also take into account any monentary savings. A majority of coffee and grocery establishments provide discounts and or reimbursements for using resuable items. Starbucks for example provide customers with a 10 cent discount when using a reusable mug and whole foods offers a 5 cent discount for reusable bags. The calculator will show the savings on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis based on how much a consumer uses.
This program may help local authorites and green groups come up with ways to motivate people to use reusable items. If the federal government came up with a program that pays or discounts individals for using resubale materials then im certain the amount of waste created will be greatly reduced.
