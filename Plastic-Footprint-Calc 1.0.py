#.... This program is designed to input various plastic items such as plastic straws, cups and bags and how much you use
# of each item. For example I used 15 straws this week and I created this many pounds of plastic waste for the week.
# the goal is to have the program be able to calculate multiple items at once instead of one at a time.
# for example it will tell you your combined total of plastic waste based on how many straws bags and cups used etc.
# The program will take that data and compare it to the national average in the USA
# The Program will also take monetary savings into account if you curretly visit a place that offers it
# Starbucks and whole foods are one of the places that offer a discount based on using reusable items
# If the user does visit one of theses places then a monenetary savings for the week month and year will be displayed.
